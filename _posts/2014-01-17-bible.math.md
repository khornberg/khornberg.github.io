`bible.math.js` parses bible references and can do math on them. 

`bible.math` was created in the process of creating the [Bible reading planner](http://khornberg.github.io/bible-reading-planner). It is a math extention to John Dyer's [bib.ly](http://bib.ly).

### Use Cases

* Create a bible reading plan based on an amount to be read.
* Determine context of a verse (+ or - 5 verses)
* Calculate how much one has read
* Others I don't know

### Usage

The easist way is with bower: `bower install bible.math --save`.

Otherwise more detailed instructions are on the [project page](https://github.com/khornberg/bible.math.js).
