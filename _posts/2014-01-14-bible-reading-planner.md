How often do you start a bible reading plan but do not finish as you find out the chunk of Bible is too much or too little?  

Do you want a plan that fits a specific schedule and the plan you found doesn't fit?  
Do you want a plan that starts on February 29th and finishes June 6th?  
Do you want a plan that to read the bible in two years or 90 days?  

[Bible reading planner](http://khornberg.github.io/bible-reading-planner) intends to allow you to do just that.

One specifies a sequence, duration, and amount to read. The app creates the plan which you can save or share.

#### About

Bible reading planner began using [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and is hosted on [Github](http://github.com). Contributions and issues are welcome.  

Someday, you might be able to create your own plans and use it; begin the plan at an arbitrary reference (e.g. Joshua 2:23); track your progress; or change the language.
